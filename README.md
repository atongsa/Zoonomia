# Pipeline for calculating segments of heterozygosity from a mapped .bam file
# Scripts adapted to run on an SGE/bash environment
# paths are hardcoded in the scripts, matching directories need to be created 

1. Create a table of coverages per scaffold and discard anoumalous scaffolds:

qsub cov_and_disc.txt

2. Calculate average heterozygosity and windowed heterozygosity per sample

qsub hetcalc.txt

3. Calculate SoH per sample

for i in `ls -1 ./50kb_scaffolds_het/`; do 
  cat ${i}|python3 mammals.py > ${i}".soh"; 
done
